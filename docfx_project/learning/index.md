<b>Welcome!</b> Looks like you are taking the next step on the OpenZiti adventure. That's great!
</p>

Here you'll find material geared towards understanding what Ziti is all about. This documentation will help you 
on the journey towards understanding what Zero Trust is, why it's so important, how you can leverage Zero Trust in 
your solutions. You'll see how you can take the trust out of the network entirely by putting that trust where it 
belongs, as close to your application as possible. With Ziti, that trust doesn't stop at the device. With Ziti, you 
can use one of our SDKs and embed those zero trust principles directly into your application!

To the left you will see some categories for you to choose from. Explore these categories and find one that is right 
for you and jump in!

## Application Embedded Zero Trust

OpenZiti is really about application embedded, Zero Trust. Though the project provides [tunneling applications](~/ziti/clients/tunneler.md)
for all major operating systems, the *real* power of Ziti shines through when embedding an SDK into your application.

The left sidebar will contain the various exercises you can follow along for your favorite language. Pick one and 
jump in! If you don't know where to start, I'd recommend just starting with the [Simple HTTP Client/Server](./http/http.md)
